# CampusLoop

CampusLoop is a modern campus community app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs/). It provides a platform for students to connect, share resources, discover events, and access campus services—all in one place.
